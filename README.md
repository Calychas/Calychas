<h1 align="center">Hi there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Calychas/Calychas/main/gifs/hand.gif" width="30px">, I'm Kacper Le≈õniara </h1>
<h3 align="center">Geospatial AI Researcher @ <a href="https://kraina.ai">Kraina AI</a> <br> ML & MLOps Engineer @ <a href="https://github.com/getindata">GetInData | Part of Xebia</a></h3>

I'm a Wroc≈Çaw based ML Engineer with a deep affection for this city and a passion for the geospatial domain. I enjoy cycling, owning (and fixing regularly) both a vintage road bike and an MTB one. One could also say that I'm a smart-home enthusiast as I'm overburdening my Raspberry PI with numerous applications that need to be tweaked quite constantly. Recently I'm also delving into the 3D printing world and making my baby steps there. I'm interested in applying AI and Machine Learning algorithms to solve social, but most importantly practical issues.

Professionally, I'm an ML/MLOps Engineer with over two years of experience, proficient in machine learning technologies, Python, SQL, and geospatial analysis. I'm equally skilled in DevOps practices, having worked with Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, and Google Cloud Platform. My diverse background also includes experience as a Frontend Developer. I have a Master's in Data Science from Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology. Additionally, I published research in the geospatial domain and am a co-author of an open-source Geo AI library under the Kraina AI Research Group at WUST.
